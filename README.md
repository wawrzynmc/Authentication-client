<h2>🧻 Descriptions 🧻</h2>

Applications allows to perform some basic actions associated with authentication and partly with authorization.

The main aim of the project creation was to posses/develop skills connceted with web development. 

**[API](https://github.com/wawrzynmc/Authentication-server)** used in project is also designed on my own.

The project is not inspired by any existing project and has been fully done by myself 😇.
